# Deep Learning

## Course Objectives  

A student who has met the objectives of this course will be able to:  

- Demonstrate knowledge of machine learning terminology, including likelihood functions, maximum likelihood, Bayesian inference, feed-forward, convolutional, sequential and Transformer neural networks, and error backpropagation.  
- Understand and explain the choices and limitations of models for a given setting.  
- Apply and analyze results from deep learning models in exercises and project work.*  
- Plan, delimit, and carry out an applied or methods-oriented project collaboratively with peers and a supervisor.*  
- Assess and summarize project results in relation to aims, methods, and available data.*  
- Execute the project and interpret results using computational frameworks for GPU programming (e.g., PyTorch).*  
- Structure and write a concise technical report including problem formulation, methods, experiments, evaluation, and conclusions.*  
- Organize and present project results in a final presentation and report.*  
- Read, evaluate, and provide feedback on the work of other students.  

\*If generative AI is used in these phases, it must be documented and critically assessed. A checklist will be provided and should be submitted with the report.
